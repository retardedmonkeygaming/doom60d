Doom 550D

:Summary: Experimental Doomgeneric port for the Canon EOS 550D.

Place authorized Doom-family IWAD files in ``ML/DOOM/``. The Games menu lists
up to 32 alphabetically sorted files with a ``.wad`` extension and an ``IWAD``
header. PWAD level and mod files are not offered as standalone games. Restart
the camera after changing the selected WAD once Doom has run.

Savegames and settings
----------------------

The module creates ``ML/DOOM``, ``ML/DOOM/SAVES`` and ``ML/DOOM/CONFIG``.
Savegames use a hash of the exact WAD filename so games remain separated::

    ML/DOOM/SAVES/<iwad hash>.D<slot>

Selecting a slot with SET saves directly. Doom menu options, music volume and
sound-effect volume are stored in ``ML/DOOM/CONFIG``.

New saves include a format version and WAD fingerprint. Damaged or mismatched
saves are rejected as ``INCOMPATIBLE SAVEGAME``; legacy v0.4 saves remain
readable and incompatible weapons are replaced safely.

Debug logging
-------------

``Games > Doom > Debug logging`` is persistent and defaults to ``OFF``. Enable
it before reproducing a problem to write ``DOOM550D.LOG`` and ``DOOMRAW.LOG``
in ``ML/LOGS``. Select ``Clear Doom logs`` to remove only files matching
``ML/LOGS/DOOM*.LOG``. The action is refused while Doom is running and never
removes WADs, savegames or configuration files.

Controls
--------

* Arrows: move and turn
* Hold zoom in (+): run
* Hold zoom out (-) plus left/right: strafe left/right
* SET: fire; confirm in menus
* PLAY: use/open doors and switches
* Rear wheel: previous/next owned weapon
* DISP. (called INFO internally by Magic Lantern): automap; back in menus
* MENU: open/close the Doom menu
* Delete/Trash three times quickly: open the secret cheat menu; back inside it
* Q: confirm the Doom quit dialog

ISO, depth-of-field and shutter controls are deliberately not used because
Canon can process them below the module input layer.

Secret cheat menu
-----------------

During an active single-player level, press Delete/Trash three times within
1.2 seconds. The first two presses intentionally do nothing. The third opens a
paused Doom-style menu for classic cheats, music present in the active IWAD,
and maps present in the active IWAD. Use up/down to select, SET to activate,
and left, INFO, MENU or Delete/Trash to go back.

Stateful cheats use Doom-style sliders. IDDT has three positions: normal map,
full map, and map plus objects. Active music and levels are marked ``PLAYING``.
Classic gameplay cheats remain disabled on Nightmare as in Doom; IDDT and
level warps retain their original exceptions.

Display
-------

In ``Options > Screen Size``, move one step right past Doom's standard
fullscreen setting to select the extra unofficial fullscreen. It renders
gameplay at 360x240 and presents each game pixel as an exact 2x2 block on the
720x480 display, without interpolation. The setting can be changed during
gameplay. The status bar is hidden; menus, the automap and other non-gameplay
screens retain Doom's classic 320x200 layout.

Audio
-----

MUS music is rendered by a 24-voice low-CPU synthesizer with band-limited
tables at 24 kHz, linearly interpolated and mixed with Doom's 8-bit effects in
one 48 kHz mono Canon ASIF-DMA stream. Instrument families use several
inexpensive waveforms, envelopes and percussion. The result has an AdLib-like
retro character but is not cycle-accurate OPL2.

The installed Magic Lantern core and ``550D_109.sym`` must export the Canon
audio functions required by the module. When debug logging is enabled, audio
render timing and missed deadlines are written to ``ML/LOGS/DOOM550D.LOG`` on
shutdown.

This module is only for the Canon EOS 550D with firmware 1.0.9. It remains
experimental; back up the SD card before installation.
